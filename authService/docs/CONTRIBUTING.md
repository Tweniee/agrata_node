## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. Please ensure your code follows these standards:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Coding Standards

#### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names

#### File Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/     # Route handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/      # Custom middleware
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/         # Database models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/         # API routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/       # Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/          # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/          # TypeScript definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/         # Configuration files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/          # Test files
```

#### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: kebab-case (e.g., `user-controller.ts`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserService`)
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `getUserById`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`)

### Testing

#### Test Structure
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows

#### Writing Tests
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('UserController', () => {
  describe('register', () => {
    it('should create a new user with valid data', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should return error for invalid email', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

#### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- user.test.ts
```

### Documentation

#### Code Documentation
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

```typescript
/**
 * Authenticates a user with email and password
 * @param email - User's email address
 * @param password - User's password
 * @returns Promise resolving to authentication result
 * @throws {AuthenticationError} When credentials are invalid
 */
async function authenticateUser(email: string, password: string): Promise<AuthResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### API Documentation
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Include request/response examples
- Document error responses

### Security Guidelines

#### Security Checklist
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Use parameterized queries
- [ ] Implement proper authentication
- [ ] Add rate limiting where appropriate
- [ ] Log security events
- [ ] Handle errors securely (no sensitive data in error messages)

#### Security Review Process
All security-related changes require:
- Security team review
- Penetration testing (for major changes)
- Documentation updates

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test changes
- `chore`: Build/tooling changes

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
fix(validation): handle edge case in email validation
docs(api): update authentication endpoint documentation
```

### Release Process

1. Create release branch from `develop`
2. Update version numbers
3. Update CHANGELOG.md
4. Test thoroughly
5. Merge to `main` and tag release
6. Deploy to production
7. Merge back to `develop`
